# PSO_Active_Learning_Strategy
Using Standard Particle Swarm Optimization as a Query Strategy for Active Learning Model with Sklearn Dataset

Uses ALiPY python module for Active Learnign framework. 


## Query Strategy 

Particles fly around search and find best postions to increase accuracy of model on each iteration. 
The position of each particle represents the image selected for training. 

Dimensions = Number of Unlabels images
